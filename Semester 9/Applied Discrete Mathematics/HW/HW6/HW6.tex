		\tab Related to the merge sort is a somewhat more efficient procedure called the quick sort. Here we start with a list
		$L: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, and use $a_1$ as a pivot to develop two sublists $L_1$ and $L_2$ as follows. For $i > 1$, if $a_i < a_1$, place $a_i$ at the end of the first list being developed (this is $L_1$ at the end of the process); otherwise, place a, at the end of the second list $L_2$.
		
		\tab After all $a_1$, $i > 1$, have been processed, place $a_1$ at the end of the first list. Now apply quick sort recursively to each of the lists $L_1$ and $L_2$ to obtain sublists $L_{11}$, $L_{12}$, $L_{21}$, and $L_{22}$. Continue the process until each of the resulting sublists contains one element. The sublists are then ordered, and their concatenation gives the ordering sought for the original list $L$.
