FIRST to create the database go to the the CREATION folder.
In the folder you should find CREATETABLEQUERY.sql
This file is also our DDL file.

After this run product.sql to fill products after selecting videogamestore as your main schema
then EXAMPLE.sql file 
this will fill in data into the database
